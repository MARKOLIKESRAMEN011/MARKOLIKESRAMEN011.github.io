### CPSC 120

* Lab 7, part 2

For me, lab 7, part two (the one about parking), is a favorite of mine because of how interesting and fun it was to write the code (even though it was confusing at times). Of course, I did learn how to truly implement && and the or operator into coding, especially when dealing with so many variables that you need to compare and contrast so it becomes critical to know when to use parentheses. Likewise, I also learned how to apply these logical operators to any real world example such as the one I did here.

* Lab 6, part two

I also enjoyed lab 6, part two (the one about blackjack), as I am quite fond of blackjack after having played it many times before, even though it was mostly in video games. Like I mentioned for lab 7, part two, I learned how to apply logical operators to real world examples, as well as how to check if a player enters the right amount of cards in their argument input (including a.out). Furthermore, it was also interesting to write the function that actually determined if the card’s names were legitimate (which was done by using the or and ! operators).

* Lab 3, part 1

Lastly, my favorite one was lab 3, part one (the one about pizza price), as it was really the first time I actually developed a piece of code that could be used in a real world setting. At the time, this lab helped me reinforce the idea of how to utilize double variables as well as call other functions, which proved to be essential for other labs later down the road. Likewise, I personally like it since this piece of code truly emphasizes how far i’ve come in this course, in terms of my programming abilities: from starting out as a basic programmer struggling to open files or declare variables, to becoming a skilled programmer with several hours of coding experience under my belt.
